                <h1>Sat Sri Akal üôèüèΩ</h1>
                <p>
                    I'm Satnam, chances are you're reading this after someone you know suggested to you that you and I could potentially be a good match. I think it's a beautiful possibility!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Typing the bullet points on this page felt very superficial and doesn't really describe me as a person very well. So I thought I'd write a few lines about what I value as an introduction and share what I hope to find.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We all have a limited amount of time in our lives, and I believe in living to the fullest and <b>celebrating</b> this beautiful experience as much as possible. I've been incredibly fortunate because of the people around me. Their kindness, lovingness, and optimism have helped me grow personally, professionally, and spiritually. I hope to continue growing, ideally with someone who also wants to grow, because I think pursuing growth is the richest way to celebrate life.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Other than wanting to grow, I also value taking good care of body and health. I think being healthy unlocks a lot e.g. great views at the end of hikes, playing sports, and feeling confident üòâ
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There is more, but I also don‚Äôt want this to become an essay üòÑ  but I hope this gives you a glimpse of who I am. Cheers!
